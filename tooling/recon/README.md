# Network Analysis

The **network** category covers reconnaissance, port scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability mapping. The goal is to understand how to systematically discover and profile targets on a network.

Network reconnaissance is the first and most critical phase of any assessment.

## 📡 What This Section Covers

-   Network discovery (finding live hosts)
-   Port scanning techniques (TCP/UDP)
-   Service and version enumeration
-   Operating system (OS) detection
-   Using scripting engines for automation
-   Bypassing firewalls and IDS

---

## 🔧 Tools Included

Each tool includes its own README with a detailed guide.

### **Nmap (Network Mapper)**
The industry-standard tool for network exploration and security auditing.
→ **[Go to /nmap](./nmap/)**

(Other tools like **masscan** and **smbmap** will be added later.)

## 🧠 Philosophy

Effective network scanning is not about running noisy, aggressive scans. It's about being methodical, quiet, and precise.

-   **Start with broad discovery** to identify live hosts.
-   **Narrow down to specific targets** for deep port scanning.
-   **Enumerate services** to find potential entry points.
-   **Correlate findings** to build a complete picture of the network topology.

Every guide here focuses on **why a specific scan type is used**, not just the command flags.

More tools and techniques will be added as the network section grows.
