# Wireless Attacks

This section is all about hacking WiFi. We'll look at how the data flies through the air, how to capture it, and how real attacks work.

The goal is to understand what's happening with the raw data, not just to memorize commands. Breaking into WiFi is a common way for hackers to get into a network, so learning this is super important.

## 📡 What This Section Covers

-   The different types of WiFi data (frames)
-   How to put your WiFi card in "monitor mode"
-   Grabbing WPA/WPA2 handshakes
-   PMKID attacks (another way to get in)
-   Kicking devices off the network (deauth attacks)
-   Getting captures ready for password cracking
-   How to use the tools together

## 🔧 Tools Included

Each tool has its own README file.

### **Aircrack-NG Suite**
The original WiFi hacking toolkit for capturing, attacking, and cracking.
→ **[Go to /aircrack-ng](./aircrack-ng/)**

(Other tools like **hcxdumptool** and **wifite** will be added later.)

## 🧠 My Goal

Hacking WiFi is really about understanding:

-   How data packets move through the air.
-   How devices prove who they are to the network.
-   How the WiFi router (access point) answers.
-   How an attacker can grab or mess up that conversation.

Every guide here focuses on **why the attack works**, not just the commands.

More tools will be added as I learn them.
