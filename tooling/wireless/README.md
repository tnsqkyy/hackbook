# Wireless Attacks

The **wireless** category focuses on Wi‑Fi hacking, 802.11 frame behavior, capture techniques, and attack workflows. This section is designed to teach not only how to run tools, but how wireless protocols actually behave at the packet level.

Wireless attacks are one of the most common entry points in real‑world engagements. Understanding them deeply is a core skill for any pentester.

## 📡 What This Section Covers

* How 802.11 works (management, control, data frames)
* Monitor mode, injection, and chipset capabilities
* Capturing WPA/WPA2 handshakes
* PMKID attacks
* Deauthentication and frame manipulation
* Converting captures to crackable formats
* Tool workflows and analysis techniques

---

## 🔧 Tools Included

Each tool in this directory includes its own README.

### **Aircrack‑NG Suite**

The classic toolkit for Wi‑Fi auditing: capture, attack, convert, and crack.

→ **[Go to /aircrack-ng](./aircrack-ng/)**

(Additional tools like **hcxdumptool** or **wifite** will be added later.)

## 🧠 Philosophy

Wireless hacking is not about memorizing commands.
It is about understanding:

* how frames move through the air,
* how clients authenticate,
* how access points respond,
* and how attackers can disrupt or capture those interactions.

Every guide in this folder focuses on **why the attack works**, not only how to run it.
