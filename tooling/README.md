# Tooling

The **tooling** section is all about the tools of the trade. For every tool, I focus on **why** it's important, how it works, and how it's used in a real hacking scenario.

Hacking is not about memorizing commands. Its about understanding the tools and the logic behind them.

##  Categories

Tools are sorted by what they do, to keep things organized as this project grows.

### **1. Reconnaissance & Scanning**
Finding computers, services, and open ports on a network.
 **[Go to /recon](./recon/)**

---

### **2. Traffic Analysis & Sniffing**
Grabbing and looking at the data that moves across a network.
 **[Go to /sniffing](./sniffing/)**

---

### **3. Wireless Attacks**
Hacking WiFi networks.
 **[Go to /wireless](./wireless/)**

---

### **4. Password Cracking & Hash Attacks**
Guessing passwords and cracking password hashes.
 **[Go to /password-cracking](./password-cracking/)**

---

### **5. Exploitation Frameworks**
Toolkits that make hacking easier and more automatic.
 **[Go to /exploitation](./exploitation/)**

---

### **6. Post-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation**
What to do after you get in: keep access, get more power, and move around.
 **[Go to /post-exploitation](./post-exploitation/)**

---

### **7. Utilities & System Essentials**
Helpful little tools that make a hacker's job easier.
 **[Go to /utilities](./utilities/)**

##  My Goal

My goal for each tool is to explain:

*   What it does
*   Why a hacker needs it
*   How it works on the inside
*   How real attackers use it
*   Example commands

This section is about understanding, not memorizing.

##  What's Next

Later, I'll connect these tools to:

*   Basic network knowledge
*   The steps of a hacking project
*   The labs and walkthroughs
