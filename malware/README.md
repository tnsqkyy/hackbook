# Malware

This directory contains proofs-of-concept (PoCs) and simple implementations of various malware types for **educational and research purposes only**.

The goal is to understand how they work internally, their attack vectors, and their potential impact by building them from scratch in a controlled environment.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This section is not for building malicious tools. It is for deconstructing them. By writing simple versions of malware, we can better understand:

-   Core infection and persistence mechanisms.
-   Data manipulation and exfiltration techniques.
-   Command and Control (C2) patterns.
-   Defensive and detection strategies.

This is a critical part of an offensive security education — know your enemy by understanding how they build their weapons.
