# Malware

This folder has simple examples of different malware types, which I built myself for **learning and research purposes only**.

The idea is to understand how malware works, the ways it can attack a system, and the damage it can do by building it in a safe lab.

A program that looks normal but has malicious code hidden inside.

## 🧠 My Goal

The goal here isn't to build bad things. It's to **take them apart to see how they work**. By building simple versions of malware, we can learn:

-   How they infect computers and stay there.
-   How they steal or damage information.
-   How they talk to the attacker.
-   How we can spot and stop them.

To beat an attacker, you need to know how they build their tools.
