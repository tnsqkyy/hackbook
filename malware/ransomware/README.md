# Simple Ransomware (Beginner PoC)

This directory contains a **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Simple Ransomware** implemented in Python, designed specifically for beginners to understand the fundamental concepts behind ransomware attacks.

Our goal is to demystify how these threats operate by examining a simplified version, focusing on core mechanics rather than advanced evasion techniques. This version now uses AES-256, a strong, industry-standard encryption algorithm.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of building and analyzing this simple ransomware code is to:

*   **Understand How It Works:** Grasp the basic steps that ransomware takes to hijack data using strong encryption.
*   **Analyze Attacker Mindset:** Examine how an attacker thinks about executing an attack.
*   **Highlight the Danger:** Show that creating a basic form of malware is not overly complex, thereby raising awareness about exercising caution when running files from unknown sources.
*   **Learn About Strong Encryption:** Understand how real-world encryption algorithms like AES are implemented in an attack scenario.

## 🔬 How It Works: Step-by-Step

`ransomware.py` performs the following steps:

### **1. Discover and Identify Target Files**
The script scans the current directory for files it can encrypt. It intentionally skips `ransomware.py` itself and `README.md` to avoid self-destruction.

### **2. Encrypt File Content (Using AES-256)**
*   It opens each target file and reads its entire content in binary format.
*   It uses the `pycryptodome` library to perform strong AES-256 encryption in GCM mode. This involves:
    *   Generating a random `salt`.
    *   Deriving a secure encryption key from the hardcoded password and the salt using `PBKDF2` (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2).
    *   Encrypting the content and generating an authentication `tag`.
*   It overwrites the original file with the `salt`, `nonce`, `tag`, and the `ciphertext`. The file is now encrypted and unreadable without the key.

### **3. Display Ransom Note**
After all target files have been encrypted, the script displays a simple message on the screen, demanding the user send money to a specified cryptocurrency address to receive the decryption key.

### **4. Decrypt Files (If Key is Correct)**
*   The user is prompted to enter a "decryption key."
*   If the key matches the hardcoded key (`fr33_my_f1l3s_n0w`), the script reads the encrypted file, extracts the salt, nonce, and tag, and uses the key to decrypt the content.
*   If the key is incorrect, the decryption will fail, and the files will remain encrypted.

## 🚀 How to Run It

**Critical Warning:** Always run this code in a safe, isolated environment (e.g., a virtual machine) and only on files that you **explicitly agree** to be modified. Do not run it on critical files or systems!

To simulate the ransomware's behavior:

1.  **Ensure `pycryptodome` is installed:**
    ```bash
    pip install pycryptodome
    ```

2.  **Create a test text file** in the same directory as `ransomware.py`, for example: `target_file.txt` with content "This is a secret message."

3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python3 ransomware.py
    ```
    You will see a series of `DEBUG` messages showing the encryption process, followed by the ransom note and a prompt to enter the decryption key.

4.  **Check the encrypted file:** Open `target_file.txt` in a text editor. You will see garbled binary data, as the file is now properly encrypted.

5.  **Decrypt:** At the prompt, enter the correct key:
    ```
    Please enter the decryption key to restore your files: fr33_my_f1l3s_n0w
    ```
    You will see a confirmation message, and `target_file.txt` will be restored to its original content.

## 💡 Key Learnings

*   **Surprising Simplicity:** Even with a powerful encryption library, the logic to create a program capable of "locking" files is straightforward. This highlights the importance of not running untrusted scripts.
*   **Real Encryption:** Unlike Base64, AES-256 provides strong confidentiality. Without the key, the data is practically irrecoverable.
*   **Defense is Crucial:** Understanding how attackers build their tools helps us better comprehend effective defense mechanisms. Always back up your data, use antivirus software, and be wary of suspicious files.
