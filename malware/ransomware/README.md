# Simple Ransomware (A Beginner's Example)

This folder contains a **Simple Ransomware** made in Python. It's an example program (or "Proof-of-Concept") built for beginners to understand the basic idea behind how ransomware works.

Our goal is to see how these attacks work by looking at a simple version. This code uses AES-256, which is a very strong and real-world encryption method.

##  What's the Point?

The reason for building and looking at this simple ransomware is to:

*   **Understand the Steps:** Learn the basic process ransomware uses to lock up files with strong encryption.
*   **Think Like an Attacker:** See how a hacker might think when they plan an attack.
*   **Show the Danger:** Prove that making a basic version of malware isn't super hard, which reminds us to be careful with strange files.
*   **Learn About Encryption:** See how real encryption like AES is used in an attack.

##  How It Works: Step-by-Step

`ransomware.py` does the following:

### **1. Finds Files to Encrypt**
The script looks in its own folder for files to lock up. It's smart enough to skip itself (`ransomware.py`) and this `README.md` file.

### **2. Encrypts the Files (with AES-256)**
*   It opens a target file and reads all the data.
*   It uses the `pycryptodome` library to do strong AES-256 encryption. In simple terms, this means it scrambles the file's content using a password. It also adds some random data (`salt`, `nonce`) to make the encryption unique and secure for each file.
*   It replaces the original file content with this new, scrambled data. The file is now locked and unreadable without the right password.

### **3. Shows a Ransom Note**
After locking all the files, the script prints a message on the screen, telling the user to send money to get their files back.

### **4. Unlocks the Files (If you have the key)**
*   The script asks you to type in the "decryption key."
*   If the key is correct (`fr33_my_f1l3s_n0w`), the script will use it to unscramble the files and bring them back to normal.
*   If the key is wrong, the files stay locked forever.

##  How to Run It

**Critical Warning:** Only run this in a safe place, like a virtual machine. Only use it on files you don't care about! Do not run this on your main computer!

To test it out:

1.  **Make sure you have `pycryptodome`:**
    ```bash
    pip install pycryptodome
    ```

2.  **Create a test file** in the same folder. For example, `target_file.txt` with "this is a secret message" inside.

3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python3 ransomware.py
    ```
    You'll see some `DEBUG` messages as it encrypts the file, then the ransom note and a prompt for the key.

4.  **Check the file:** Try to open `target_file.txt`. It will look like garbage because it's encrypted.

5.  **Decrypt it:** At the prompt, type the correct key:
    ```
    Please enter the decryption key to restore your files: fr33_my_f1l3s_n0w
    ```
    The script will confirm, and your file will be back to normal.

##  What I Learned

*   **It's Surprisingly Simple:** Even with strong encryption, the basic idea of a file-locking program is not that complicated. This is why you should **never run scripts you don't trust**.
*   **Real Encryption is Strong:** Unlike simple scrambling, AES-256 is the real deal. Without the key, the data is basically gone for good.
*   **Defense is Key:** Understanding how attackers build their tools is the first step to defending against them. Always have backups, use antivirus software, and be very suspicious of strange files.
