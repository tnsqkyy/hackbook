# Labs & Walkthroughs

The **labs** directory is a dedicated space for documenting my journey through various cybersecurity training platforms and custom lab environments. It focuses on practical application, problem-solving methodologies, and detailed write-ups of challenges.

This section is about applying theoretical knowledge to real-world (simulated) scenarios, understanding attack paths, and documenting the process from initial access to flag capture.
