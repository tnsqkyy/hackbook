# Labs & Walkthroughs

The **labs** section is where I post my notes and walkthroughs from different hacking practice sites and my own custom labs.

It's all about putting theory into practice and writing down how I solve different challenges, from the first step to the last.

##  Platforms

Challenges are sorted by the website or platform they came from.

### **1. TryHackMe**

##  My Goal

For each lab walkthrough, I try to explain:

*   **The Goal:** What was the main objective?
*   **My Process:** The steps I took, the tools I used, and what I was thinking.
*   **The Weakness:** Where the security flaw was and how to use it.
*   **The Solution:** How I beat the challenge and got the flag.
*   **What I Learned:** The main lessons or new tricks I picked up.

The idea is to show my practical skills and to have a record of how I solve problems.

##  What's Next

As I do more, I'll add more labs from other places:

*   HackTheBox machine walkthroughs
*   Notes on building my own practice labs
*   Solutions from CTF (Capture The Flag) events
