# Hackbook

**Hackbook** is my personal notebook for learning ethical hacking.  
It's where I keep notes on everything I learn: the ideas, the tests, the mistakes, and the 'aha!' moments—not just the commands.

## Current Sections

### Foundations
The absolute basics of cybersecurity, covering how computers and networks actually work.
→ **[Go to /foundations](./foundations/)**

### Tooling
A hand-picked list of important hacking tools. For each tool, I explain:

- What it's for
- How it works inside
- How real attackers use it
- Practical examples

→ **[Go to /tooling](./tooling/)**

### Labs & Write-ups
My notes and solutions from cybersecurity training sites like TryHackMe and my own practice labs.

→ **[Go to /labs](./labs/)**

### Malware
I rebuild simple malware here for learning purposes, to understand how it works from the inside.

→ **[Go to /malware](./malware/)**
