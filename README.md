# Hackbook

**Hackbook** is my long-term, structured notebook for becoming a pentester.  
It records concepts, experiments, failures, and breakthroughs — not just commands.

Currently, only **Tooling** is available, but the repository is designed to scale into a complete offensive-security knowledge base.

## Current Sections

### Tooling
A curated collection of essential offensive-security tools, covering:

- Recon & Scanning  
- Sniffing & Traffic Analysis  
- Wireless Attacks  
- Password Cracking  
- Exploitation Frameworks  
- Post-Exploitation  
- Utilities  

Each tool includes: purpose, internal logic, real attacker use-cases, and practical examples.

### Labs & Write-ups
Documented journeys through various cybersecurity training platforms and custom lab environments.

→ **[Go to /labs](./labs/)**

### Malware
Analysis and educational re-implementation of malware to understand their internal mechanics.

→ **[Go to /malware](./malware/)**

## Roadmap

Planned sections:

- **Network Fundamentals** — OSI, routing, switching, VLAN, ARP, DHCP, DNS  
- **Pentesting Workflow** — recon → exploitation → priv-esc → persistence → reporting  
- **Offensive Techniques** — web, WiFi, bruteforce, phishing, memory exploits  
- **Defensive Insight** — logs, detection, SIEM  
- **Labs & Write-ups** — TryHackMe, HackTheBox, custom labs

## Purpose

To build a clear, deep, and practical record of my path from beginner to red teamer, focusing on *why* things work — not just the commands.
